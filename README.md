# Image Classifier App

### Why an image classifier app?

In this tutorial, you will find images with Bing, upload your images to the cloud, label your images to classify the data and train a model to recognize the categories. You will then connect your model to a PowerApp. This way, you can upload a picture to your app and it will tell you what it sees.
